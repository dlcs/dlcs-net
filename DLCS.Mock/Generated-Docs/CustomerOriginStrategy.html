<h1>CustomerOriginStrategy</h1>

<p>As a customer you can provide information to the DLCS to allow it to fetch your images from their origin endpoints. Every customer has a default origin strategy, which is for the DLCS to attempt to fetch the image from its origin URL without presenting credentials. This is fine for images that are publicly available, but is unlikely to be appropriate for images you are exposing from your asset management system. You might have a service that is available only to the DLCS, or an FTP site. The DLCS has a predefined set of mechanisms for obtaining resources over HTTP, FTP, S3 etc. In your customer origin strategies you match these predefined strategies to regexes that match your origin URLs and credentials that the DLCS can use when requesting your assets.</p>

<pre>/customers/{0}/originStrategies/{1}</pre><br/>
