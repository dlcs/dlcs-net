# AuthService

IIIF Authentication Service configuration. The services configured here are exposed by the DLCS on IIIF Image API endpoints, so that a viewer that supports the IIIF Auth specification can interact with them to acquire a cookie that will gain access to the images. The DLCS enforces access control on a customer's behalf (this is essential for performance when many hundreds of image tiles are requested). This means it is the DLCS that implements the IIIF auth flow on your behalf. In one special case, 'clickthrough', you can configure an auth service in the DLCS that needs no runtime interation with your own systems. However, for more complex scenarios, the DLCS will need to direct the user to your (customer) servers during the auth flow, so that they can authenticate against your system. The DLCS then needs to query your system to acquire that user's roles,and thereby determine what level of service it can offer the user for a given protected image. See RoleProvider for imformation. The fields of AuthService give you control over how the service will be presented in a viewer that implements the IIF auth flow.
