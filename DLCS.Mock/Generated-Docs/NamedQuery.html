<h1>NamedQuery</h1>

<p>A named query is a URI pattern available on dlcs.io (i.e., not this API) that will return a IIIF resource such as a collection, or manifest, or sequence, or canvas. For example:

```
https://dlcs.io/resources/iiifly/manifest/43/ae678999
```

This query is is an instance of the following template:

```
https://dlcs.io/resources/{customer}/{named-query}/{space}/{string1}
```

This customer (iiifly) has a named query called 'manifest' that takes two parameters - the space and the string1 metadata field. The query is internally defined to use an additional field - number1 -  and to generate a manifest with one sequence, with each canvas in the sequence having one image. The images selected by the query must all have string1=ae678999 in this case, and are ordered by number1.  An image query against the dlcs API returns a collection of DLCS Image objects. a Named Query uses an DLCS image query but then projects these images and  constructs a IIIF resource from them, using the parameters provided. Information on designing and configuring named queries is provided in a special topic.</p>
<p><b>UNSTABLE Currently the named query implementation is a placeholder,</b></p>
